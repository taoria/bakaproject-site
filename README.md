# Project Baka
Baka is a 2d framework to build games

but this can't work at all because the coder just codes it for fun

This [site](https://taoria.github.io/bakaproject-site/) is based on

 [Jekyll][1] theme for [@jasonlong][2]'s [Cayman theme][4]

 ([GitHub Pages][3])

It explains how it works

Actually it just made by me to think more visually...
